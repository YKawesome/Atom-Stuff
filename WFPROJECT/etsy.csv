Kirsten,"Apr 21, 2020",4,"I really loved everything about this robe. The font, the silk, the colors. I bought white for me and black for my bridesmaids with white font. Looks sooo nice, I can't wait to see them on my girls. My only disappointment was that it runs a little smaller than I anticipated, but that won't stop me from wearing it anyway. Since I'll be wearing a white robe, I planned on wearing something underneath it anyway :)",None,https://i.etsystatic.com/2022906345/d/il/cdec0b/2022906345/il_170x135.2022906345_8gvi.jpg?version=0,etsy.com/listing/665112524/bridesmaid-robes-bridesmaid-gift?ref=shop_review

Jennifer,"Apr 20, 2020",5,"I am beyond happy with my purchase!! Not only is the jean jacket itself of great quality, but the stitching of the name and date is as well! I went with the recommendations to purchase one size bigger than what you normally wear, and it was definitely a good choice- not too baggy and not too tight. You won't regret purchasing this item!",https://i.etsystatic.com/iap/4ae5e9/2320049663/iap_300x300.2320049663_erdd7cr7.jpg?version=0,https://i.etsystatic.com/2095005279/d/il/41e04a/2095005279/il_170x135.2095005279_rzs8.jpg?version=0,etsy.com/listing/680819927/embroidered-jean-jacket-bride-jean?ref=shop_review
